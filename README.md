IN Backend I am using Node server and MongoDB 
First you need to start your server -

To start your server use this command ---->  nodemon app.js 
                                  OR           node app.js

Then  start mongo
USE THIS COMMAND --   sudo service mongod start 
              OR   --   mongod
              
              
if there mongo is not starting then please create a folder and give the path like this
(for eg :::  i created a folder name mongodb on desktop where my project is located and give the path in your terminal...

`~/Desktop/moovlee/google-location-backend$ mongod --dbpath ~/Desktop/mongodb
`

Please use this command ------> npm install 
so all the libraries used in code will be install.
